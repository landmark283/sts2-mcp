# Changelog

## v0.7.12 - 2026-03-22

Repository release: `v0.7.12`

Bridge mod version: `0.7.12`

Bridge state schema: `2026-03-20.1`

MCP server version: `0.4.20`

### Highlights

- Replaced the MCP server's poll-heavy state sync path with a bridge frontier event stream plus event-driven wait helpers, which makes continuous combat actions noticeably faster and reduces stale-action windows.
- Added post-action settlement on the MCP side so single actions and combat sequences now wait for the next stable actionable surface instead of returning too early while the bridge is still transitioning.
- Added a full MCP-native knowledge and observation layer, so strategy content is queried through tools instead of being stuffed into prompt attachments.
- Continued token reduction work across bridge and MCP payloads by switching bridge JSON output to compact formatting and expanding compact action/state summaries.

### Bridge Mod Changes

- Added authenticated `GET /events` support that streams frontier updates directly from the bridge.
- Added frontier lifecycle hooks through `BridgeCoordinator` so the frontier store is reset on detach and pumped every main-thread tick.
- Updated the bridge HTTP writer to emit compact JSON instead of indented JSON, reducing response size without changing semantics.
- Bumped the bridge state schema to `2026-03-20.1`.
- Exposed card star-cost metadata in bridge card payloads:
- `canonical_star_cost`
- `current_star_cost`
- `has_star_cost_x`
- Preserved `semantic_state_hash` in the hydrated state payload so MCP-side event followers can reason about stable semantic snapshots.

### MCP Server Changes

- Added a persistent bridge event client that follows `/events` and maintains a live cached frontier.
- Added `sts2_wait_until_actionable`, an event-driven wait primitive that returns only when a stable actionable surface is available.
- Reworked post-action settlement:
- `performBridgeAction(...)` now settles by default instead of only waiting for the immediate action response.
- Combat actions, `end_turn`, screen transitions, and map travel now use strategy-specific settlement logic.
- Event-driven quiet-window settling now absorbs delayed follow-up surfaces such as discard selection, retain selection, reward cleanup, and next-turn hand refill.
- Fixed one of the worst failure modes in combat sequencing:
- when a sequence now runs into a blocker mid-turn, it returns partial progress with `ok: true`, `resolved: false`, `executed_steps`, and the current state instead of surfacing a misleading top-level failure.
- Added monotonic state caching on the MCP side so older `state_version` snapshots from HTTP/SSE cannot overwrite newer cached state.
- Added tool profiles so the same MCP server can expose `minimal`, `strategic`, or `debug` tool sets without turning the project into an agent framework.
- Added MCP-native knowledge tools:
- `sts2_get_knowledge`
- `sts2_get_knowledge_topics`
- `sts2_search_knowledge`
- `sts2_read_knowledge_slice`
- `sts2_list_knowledge_sections`
- Added evidence-first observation tools:
- `sts2_record_observation`
- `sts2_list_observation_entities`
- `sts2_read_observation_entity`
- Added run journaling tools:
- `sts2_journal_write`
- `sts2_journal_read`
- `sts2_journal_summarize`
- `sts2_journal_get_summary`
- `sts2_journal_list_runs`
- Added canonical knowledge content under `packages/mcp-server/knowledge/` for route planning, deck building, card evaluation, combat, bosses, enemies, relics, events, and authoring workflow.

### Live Validation

- Live combat validation confirmed that a mixed sequence such as `中和 + 打击 + 打击 + 防御 + end_turn` now completes without the old mid-sequence `state_version_conflict` failure.
- Live validation on `生存者` confirmed that:
- single `sts2_perform_action` now returns the follow-up `CARD_SELECTION` surface instead of stopping too early on the previous `COMBAT` state.
- `sts2_execute_combat_sequence` now stops cleanly at the discard selection with:
- `resolved: false`
- `reason: "card_selection_ready"`
- `executed_count: 1`
- the remaining steps still pending instead of being misreported as failed or accidentally executed.

### Upgrade Notes

- Restart the game after replacing `sts2-bridge.dll`, otherwise `/events`, schema `2026-03-20.1`, and the newer bridge payload fields will not exist in the running bridge process.
- Restart any long-lived `sts2` MCP server process after updating `packages/mcp-server/index.js`, otherwise it will continue using the older polling and settlement logic.

## v0.7.11 - 2026-03-19

Repository release: `v0.7.11`

Bridge mod version: `0.7.11`

Bridge state schema: `2026-03-19.1`

MCP server version: `0.4.19`

### Highlights

- Added full Crystal Sphere event support, including screen detection, compact event state, legal actions, and live-validated click execution.
- Reduced false `state_version` churn by hashing semantic game state instead of volatile automation and expanded action payload trees.
- Fixed multiple card-selection stability problems: drifting hand indices, missing confirm buttons on deck-card selection screens, and noisy completion errors.
- Compressed Crystal Sphere responses down to the minimum actionable shape while keeping direct action-id reconstruction possible.

### Bridge Mod Changes

- Added `EVENT_CRYSTAL_SPHERE` screen detection in the bridge state capture path.
- Added top-level `crystal_sphere` state payload with divination count, selected tool, grid size, hidden-cell count, and revealed item summaries.
- Added Crystal Sphere event options and actions into the shared event surface so indexed option tooling can address the event without a dedicated new tool.
- Fixed Crystal Sphere execution by routing through the screen-level handlers:
- `SetSmallDivination`
- `SetBigDivination`
- `OnCellClicked`
- `OnProceedButtonPressed`
- This replaces the earlier no-op path that tried to click the cell/button nodes directly.
- Introduced semantic state hashing via `CreateSemanticStateCore(...)` so transient fields like automation payloads, verbose action text, and other non-decision metadata no longer perturb `state_version`.
- Stabilized card-selection option indexing by deriving combat-hand indices from the real hand pile order instead of pure visual order.
- Added `selection_id` support to card-selection options so MCP-side rematching can survive index drift.
- Added `NDeckCardSelectScreen`-aware confirm button resolution so two-step selection flows expose the correct confirm target after cards are chosen.
- Treated benign `CompleteSelection` final-state exceptions as successful completion instead of surfacing a false internal error.
- Fixed count-prefixed image-tag compaction so strings like `9[star icon]` are rendered as `9点星辉` instead of malformed numeric text.

### MCP Server Changes

- Added compact Crystal Sphere summaries to `sts2_get_state`, `sts2_perform_action(return_state_after=true)`, and `sts2_list_actions`.
- Crystal Sphere responses now use a compact action map:
- `controls`: short strings like `0:small*` and `1:big`
- `cell_action_start_index`: the first `event_option:N` index for revealable cells
- `cells`: compact coordinate list where `event_option:(start + offset)` maps to the corresponding coordinate
- `revealed`: short strings like `4,0=gold:10`
- Suppressed duplicate `event_options` expansion on the Crystal Sphere screen, because the same decision surface is already represented in `crystal_sphere.actions`.
- Collapsed Crystal Sphere `sts2_list_actions` output into one `event_option_group` instead of enumerating every `event_option:N` row as a separate object.
- `sts2_perform_action` compact post-action summaries now preserve `crystal_sphere` state, so event follow-up decisions do not require an immediate extra `get_state`.
- `sts2_pick_option` and `sts2_resolve_card_selection` now use indexed-option helpers plus stable `selection_id` matching instead of assuming visible-option indices are fixed.
- Added `star_cost` to agent-facing card summaries and compact combat action summaries.

### Practical Result

- Live validation on a fresh local MCP process confirmed Crystal Sphere tool switching and cell reveals now change the real game state.
- Example live click: `event_option:2` advanced the event, reduced divinations from `2` to `1`, and updated the revealable-cell set as expected.
- In the tested Crystal Sphere scene, compact response sizes were reduced to roughly:
- `sts2_get_state`: ~`1.5k` chars
- `sts2_list_actions`: ~`1.1k` chars
- `sts2_perform_action(return_state_after=true)`: ~`1.6k` chars

### Upgrade Notes

- Restart the game after replacing `sts2-bridge.dll`, otherwise the new bridge payload fields and action wiring will not be loaded.
- Restart any long-lived `sts2` MCP process after updating `packages/mcp-server/index.js`, otherwise it will keep using the older summary logic.

## v0.7.10 - 2026-03-19

Repository release: `v0.7.10`

Bridge mod version: `0.7.10`

MCP server version: `0.4.18`

### Highlights

- Added native smith upgrade previews to `deck_upgrade_selection.options[*].upgrade_preview`, built from the game's own `CloneCard + UpgradeInternal` flow instead of guessed text or manually mapped values.
- Reduced high-noise MCP responses across combat, rewards, campfire, shop, and map tools so agents get the minimum usable state instead of 200-800 line raw payloads.
- Improved combat automation guidance and sequence handling so mixed combat plans can use one call instead of multiple fragile round trips.

### Bridge Mod Changes

- `BuildDeckUpgradeSelectionPayload(...)` now includes `upgrade_preview` for every smith candidate.
- Upgrade previews come from a cloned upgraded card payload, so title, cost, effect summary, description, and dynamic vars follow the same logic as the in-game preview UI.
- Rebuilt and deployed `sts2-bridge.dll` for this release.

### MCP Server Changes

- `sts2_perform_action` and `sts2_end_turn`
- `return_state_after=true` now returns a compact post-action summary instead of the full bridge state.
- Removed redundant fields such as duplicated hashes, raw action lists, and full state trees when a compact summary is available.

- `sts2_play_card_sequence` and `sts2_execute_combat_sequence`
- Added mixed combat sequence support so one sequence can include `play_card`, `use_potion`, and `end_turn`.
- Continued support for post-action reindex matching after hand shifts, draws, and target remaps.
- Compressed `executed_steps` output so exact successful steps collapse to the executed action id, while `requested_action_id` is only kept when a remap or failure actually matters.
- Updated tool descriptions and agent-facing hints to push consecutive combat actions toward sequence tools instead of parallel `sts2_perform_action` calls.

- `sts2_resolve_room_rewards`
- Added a specialized compact resolver payload.
- The tool now reports the reward resolution result, claimed rewards, selected card, executed actions, and final compact state without echoing the entire reward flow twice.
- Fixed the "safe rewards + card pick + auto proceed" one-call path so the result is usable without extra manual cleanup calls.

- `sts2_resolve_rest_site`
- Added a specialized compact resolver payload for both success and unresolved smith flows.
- Smith choice prompts now return compact preview strings such as `14:武装 -> 武装+ | 1费 | 获得5点格挡。 / 升级你手牌中的所有牌。`
- Removed duplicate `state.screen`, empty `selected_option` / `selected_upgrade_card`, and repeated rest-site sections from unresolved responses.

- `sts2_resolve_shop_visit`
- Added a specialized compact resolver payload for purchase plans, purchased items, removal choices, and final compact state.
- Shop and card-removal follow-up prompts now avoid duplicating large shop/state payload sections.

- `sts2_travel_to_coordinate`
- Added a specialized compact resolver payload.
- Travel responses now emphasize the requested coordinate, settle status, executed actions, and final compact state instead of returning the whole state tree.

- Shared payload compaction
- Added dedicated compactors for action results, room rewards, campfire, shop, travel, and combat sequences instead of relying only on a generic global compactor.
- Added payload-section deduplication to suppress repeated copies of the same summarized data.
- Added inline text compaction helpers for dense decision surfaces such as smith previews.

### Practical Result

- Smith unresolved responses dropped from roughly `7.3k` characters to about `1.0k` while still carrying upgrade decision context.
- Campfire responses now expose upgrade choices in a format that is short enough for agents but still specific enough to choose the correct upgrade.
- Mixed combat turns can be executed with fewer tool calls and lower token waste.

### Upgrade Notes

- Restart the game after replacing `sts2-bridge.dll`, otherwise the new bridge payload fields will not exist in `get_state`.
- Restart the long-lived `sts2` MCP process after updating `packages/mcp-server/index.js`, otherwise tool responses will still use the old compaction logic.
