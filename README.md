# sts2-mcp 🌌

`sts2-mcp` is a high-performance, local control stack for **Slay the Spire 2**. It bridges the gap between the game's internal state and external AI agents using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Unlike traditional screen-scraping or OCR-based solutions, `sts2-mcp` uses a **native C# bridge mod** to extract precise game data and expose legal actions directly, ensuring 100% accuracy and sub-millisecond latency.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project consists of two primary components:

### 1. `mods/sts2-bridge` (The "Sensors & Actuators")
A C#/.NET 9 mod that injects directly into the Slay the Spire 2 process.
- **State Serialization**: Converts complex in-game objects (Run, Combat, Rewards, Maps) into clean JSON.
- **Action Execution**: Directly invokes game methods to perform cards plays, selections, and navigation.
- **Discovery**: Automatically creates a session file for the MCP server to find and connect to.

### 2. `packages/mcp-server` (The "Interface")
A Node.js 22 server that implements the standard MCP.
- **Tool Mapping**: Translates bridge HTTP endpoints into standard MCP tools.
- **Safety**: Implements `state_version` guarding to prevent "stale" actions (e.g., trying to play a card that was already exhausted).
- **Optimization**: Handles complex batching for rewards, shops, and campfires to minimize LLM round trips.

## 🛠️ MCP Tools Reference

The server exposes the following tools to any MCP-compliant agent (like Claude Desktop or Antigravity):

| Tool | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `sts2_get_state` | Fetches the full current game state (Screen, Health, Deck, Relics, etc.). |
| `sts2_list_actions` | Lists all currently legal actions available to the player. |
| `sts2_perform_action` | Executes a single action by its unique ID. |
| `sts2_play_card_sequence` | Plays multiple cards in order, with automatic hand re-indexing. |
| `sts2_resolve_room_rewards` | Claims all gold/potions and optionally picks a card in one call. |
| `sts2_resolve_rest_site` | Performs a rest/smith and proceeds back to the map. |
| `sts2_resolve_card_selection` | Handles card pick/skip/transform screens perfectly. |
| `sts2_pick_option` | Picks indexed reward/event/rest/card-selection options without raw action-id guessing. |
| `sts2_travel_to_coordinate` | Resolves cleanup, waits for a stable map snapshot, and then travels to a coordinate. |
| `sts2_resolve_shop_visit` | Buys multiple items and removes a card in a single batch. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **OS**: Windows (Slay the Spire 2 is currently Windows-only).
- **Runtime**: [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Game**: A legal copy of Slay the Spire 2.

### Option A: Using Pre-compiled Release (Recommended)
1. Download the latest `sts2-bridge` release (DLL and associated files) from the Releases page.
2. Create a folder named `sts2-bridge` inside your game's `mods` directory.
   - Example: `<PATH_TO_STS2>\mods\sts2-bridge`
3. Place the downloaded files into that folder.

### Option B: Building from Source
If you prefer to compile it yourself, you will also need the [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).
Set your game installation path and build the project:

```powershell
$env:STS2_DIR = "<PATH_TO_STS2>"
dotnet build .\mods\sts2-bridge\sts2-bridge.csproj
```
*Note: This will automatically copy the build output to the game's `mods\sts2-bridge` folder.*

### Next Steps...

1. **Launch the Game**: Run Slay the Spire 2. The bridge will initialize and create a session file at `%APPDATA%\SlayTheSpire2\bridge\session.json`.
2. **Start the MCP Server**:
```powershell
node .\packages\mcp-server\index.js
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap & TODO

- [ ] **Better Tools**: Expanding the MCP toolset for more granular state queries and complex action sequences.
- [ ] **Multiplayer Support**: Enabling agents to interact with or manage cooperative/multiplayer gameplay mechanics.
- [ ] **In-Game Dialogue Integration**: Injecting AI strategy text and reasoning directly into the game's dialogue boxes for a more immersive, visual experience.

## 📝 Configuration

The MCP server looks for the bridge session file automatically. You can override it via environment variables:
- `STS2_BRIDGE_SESSION_FILE`: Path to a custom session JSON.
